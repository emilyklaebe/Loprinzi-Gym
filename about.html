				<p>Vegetable peddler, Pasquale “Charles” Loprinzi of Portland, Oregon (originally hailing from Trabia, Sicily) although inadvertently, was living his life true to these words by Ruskin. In turn, his children, and their children, would grow to do the same. </p>

				<p>In the mid 1930s, he was trying to raise five kids without the help and support of a wife. Sadly, his wife, Rosa Formosa (also hailing from Trabia) had been hospitalized due to a bout of diphtheria, which eventually left her struggling with dementia. In her thirties, she was committed to the Oregon State Hospital and would live out the rest of her years away from her husband and children.</p>p

				<p>With his eldest daughter’s help he was able to raise his children and being in the produce business, he was also able to nourish them well. In 1946 when the Loprinzi’s were dubbed, “The Strongest Family in America,” Charles declared that it was all the spinach he fed his sons that helped make them so strong. Between his sons (and a few cousins), they could lift a total of two and a half tons.
				</p>
				<p>As the story goes it all started when Charles’ young sons, Joe and Sam witnessed a strongman act at Portland’s Hippodrome Theater. They were so impressed with what they saw, (namely one of the great strength showmen of the time, Clevio Massimo) that they came home and started building their own weights.</p>

				<article>
				“We decided to make some weights out of cement, so we would take some cans and pour cement into them and put a pipe in between,” states Joe, from the article, A Man Ahead of His Time, by Jennifer Brown. He continues stating, “We couldn’t afford to buy weights in those days.” 

				Joe and his brother Sam got hooked on physical fitness and they started their first gym next to their garage where friends and neighbors would come to workout. Over the years their commitment and level of involvement increased, Joe becoming a highly popular trainer at the Multnomah Athletic Club in Portland and Sam becoming a renowned body builder winning the Most Muscular Physique category in the Mr. America competition. Sam just barely missed the title that year (1946) and was crowned, runner-up. He then went on to win the Mr. Pacific Coast contest in 1948. 

				1948 was also a landmark year in that Sam opened his own gym, aptly named, Loprinzi’s. It was a house turned workout arena and Sam’s brother Gus (a metal worker) welded up and fabricated some of Sam’s first weight lifting equipment.  Back in 1930 Gus had been slated to go to the Olympics in boxing but broke his jaw and couldn’t attend. Many of Portland’s elite athletes trained at Loprinzi’s diligently following the Loprinzi workout regimes. </p>
